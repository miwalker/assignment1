HI! My name is Michael and I am using Git for the first time.
I live in San Antonio although I am Canadian. 
Whichhhhhh of course means I love hockey - Go Canucks!
My favourite videogame is Halo 2.

###Programming Background
I have taken both CS 161 and 162 and learned C++.
I have also started learning Python - I'm a big fan so far.
I hope to build my own computer in the near future.
